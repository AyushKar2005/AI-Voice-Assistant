Here is a letter to your father:

Dear Papa,

As I sit down to write this letter to you, I am filled with so much love and gratitude for everything you have done for me. From the moment I was born, you have been my guiding light, my mentor, and my best friend.

I want to thank you for being such an amazing role model. Your hard work, dedication, and perseverance inspire me every day to strive for excellence. Your selflessness and kindness towards others have taught me the importance of empathy and compassion.

I cherish all the memories we have created together, whether it's our trips, our late-night conversations, or our silly jokes. You have always been there for me, supporting me through thick and thin. Your unwavering faith in me has given me the confidence to pursue my dreams.

I am grateful for the values you have instilled in me, such as honesty, integrity, and respect for others. Your guidance has shaped me into the person I am today. I am proud to call you my father, and I hope to make you proud too.

Thank you for being such an incredible dad. I love you more than words can express.

With all my love and appreciation,
Ayush
